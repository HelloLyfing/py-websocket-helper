py-websocket-helper
===================

While, I just need several websocket helper funcs for me, why the hell dozens of **framework** appear as the Google search result ?

This tiny project just provides three server-side-underlyfing funcs for you, which are:

 - websocket handshake
 - websocket frame decode( received from the client side )
 - websocket frame encode( string-data to frame )
